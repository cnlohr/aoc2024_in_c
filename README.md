# aoc2024_in_c

My C (I'm experimenting with mixing old-style with new style) solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

Three personal goals here:
 * Use K&R Style parsing.
 * Iterate on using less stdlibc.
 * Complete day 7.

In order to iterate more smoothly, I am using this as a test suite, as per the github CI.

We'll see how far I get.
